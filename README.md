# Java Sprint Boot Stater
A basic educational starter project for java spring boot.

## Requirements
In order to run these projects you will need to have a machine set up for Java/Springboot development. If your machine is not set up for this I highly advise giving the [repo](https://github.com/CoffeeCodeAndCreatine/developer_set_up) a read though.


## Branches
Teh purpose of this repo is to give a few different examples of what a spring boot project may look like. Each branch will have a different level of complexity and come with different features.

The plan is that each branch will be documented and have an accompanying youtube video to explain how to code, build and run the project.

* Level 1 - Hello World
* Level 2 - A Post, A Get, & an Exception
* Level 3 - Good Developers Test Their Code
* Level 4 - A Database
* Level 5 - Docker

The Main branch has all features and documents included, but if you want to go though the simple projects, you will need to clone down the listed branch itself.
