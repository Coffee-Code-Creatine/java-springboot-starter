A basic educational starter project for java spring boot.

## Requirements

In order to run these projects you will need to have a machine set up for Java/Springboot development. If your machine
is not set up for this I highly advise giving the [repo](https://github.com/CoffeeCodeAndCreatine/developer_set_up) a
read though.

To make it though this document you will need:

* Java
* Mvn
* Docker

## Modules

The purpose of these modules, as well as these projects it to give an idea of what java and spring boot looks like, and
how you can get started.
Each module is independent, however I suggest you start with 1 and work your way up.

### Module 1

Module 1 is a simple web server with a single get call retuning text. A readme for the module can be
found [here](demo1/README.md) and a youtube coding session can be found [here]().

### Module 2

Module 2 is a simple web server, this time with a get and a post that return json rather than text. A readme for the
module can be found [here](demo2/README.md) and a youtube coding session can be found [here]()

### Module 3

Module 3 is a simple web server with a get call, that also has some unit tests. A readme for the module can be
found [here](demo3/README.md) and a youtube coding session can be found [here]()

### Module 4

Module 4 is a web server with an in memory database. We create, update, delete, and list objects. A readme for the
module can be found [here](demo4/README.md) and a youtube coding session can be found [here]()

### Module 5

Module 5 is a simple web server, however this one we put in a docker container and deploy locally. A readme for the
module can be found [here](demo5/README.md) and a youtube coding session can be found [here]()
